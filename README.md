# My Learning Journey

## About Me

As a former web and iOS developer, my goal is to rejuvenate my programming skills through various different platforms and personal projects in order to return to the development space. My history in development has mostly been self-taught and on-the-fly as opposed to formal schooling. That is where I can best exercise versatility and outside-the-box solutions.Â  In general my interests are mainly in Linux development for ARM64, virtual reality, and AI. I am currently expanding my programming and game development skills by learning the following technologies:

- **Godot**: Exploring 2D and 3D game development using GDScript and Godot's powerful engine.
- **Python**: Strengthening my understanding of scripting, automation, and software development.
- **Three.js**: Learning how to create interactive 3D experiences for the web using JavaScript.
- **ARM64 Assembly**: Diving into low-level programming and computer architecture for ARM-based systems.

## Learning Resources

I am leveraging a combination of Udemy courses and YouTube tutorials to enhance my skills, focusing on hands-on projects and real-world applications.

## Goals

- Build a self contained holographic gaming console using the Orange Pi 5 Plus.
  - This system will require a custom Linux installation that will load straight into a game launcher, mimicking the behavior of an actual console.
  - The self contained display will feature a holographic display technique called Pepper's Ghost. My only interest here is to make something unique.
  - I will also be making a proprietary wireless controller from which I will benefit from peripheral development utilizing IO sensors and controllers.
  - Because the Orange Pi 5 Plus has an NPU, I hope to utilize AI for either interacting with the console itself, or driving game data/behaviors.
  - The game(s) for the console will be developed using Godot and Blender.
- Build a ground-up AR/XR headset.
  - This system is meant to be a basic augmented reality tool/assistant, not a fully featured virtual reality headset. My goal is to create a true assistant that can be interacted with by voice which will display information onto a transparent overlay.
  - My intention is to use the LG Star Wars headset with a Raspberry Pi Zero and a single LCD display.
  - I will use AI in whatever capacity I see fit as I continue to develop the idea.
- Publish a match 3 game to mobile platforms via Gadot
- Publish VR games to the Meta Quest platform
- Publish an AI assisted project tracking app
- Any other smaller projects along the way as I continue working towards my two main projects

While my personal projects may be lofty, I feel they are achievable and I learn best by having a project to work on even if the goals are beyond my reach. Follow my journey as I document my progress and share projects along the way!
